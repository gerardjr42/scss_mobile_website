## Attempting using SCSS on a website project

Yesterday I was introduced to SASS and how it gives CSS a much more readable and cleaner experience. I decided to go with SCSS as it's similar to Javascript syntax.
I delved into this project using block, element, modifiers (BEM). Nesting similar classes with parent and child corelation. 
I decided to keep my partial files seperated based on the html sections and functions. For example: config, home, main, menu, etc. This helped me keep my code organized
